Future Origins was first imagined c. 2012. The name had meaning but a purpose did not immediately materialize. I had been disillusioned by the technology that, in my perspective, was not serving the purpose I had hoped it would back in the 90s when my passion for it was first sparked. This was perhaps the early begginings of the <i>enshitification</i> (more on that later). Social media had begun it's rampage, popular search engines were returning more ads and bogus results, and the internet became increasingly powered by a small number of behemoths, asimilating anything and everything that had the ability to get peoples attention (for better or for worse).
After over a decade, new technologies have emerged, reinvigorating the idea of sharing experiences with our communities, and the global community as well. With everything from drones to 4k video cameras, generative AI to bitcoin, we strive to put technology to work and tell our story.

Although YouTube is not a new platform, I still think it's an incredibly useful platform for sharing video. Our YouTube channel is starting off with a collection of drone footage from around my home in Northern California. I'm sure the extent of the footage over the next couple years will go far beyond that. My goal is to share the cinema of natural landscapes (and seascapes). Nature is violent and unforgiving. It is an incredibly important part of humananity's origins, and the driver in our ability to innovate and adapt. I'm regularly intrigued by the thought of archaic man struggling to survive in such inhospitable environments. I revere and respect the native people that understood what it took to servive here. I hope this helps others appreciate the beauty and danger all in the same moment. Enjoy! :earth_americas: :evergreen_tree: :sun_with_face:
